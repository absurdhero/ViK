Motivations For Yet Another Editor
----------------------------------

Since I write a lot of code, I put a lot of effort into knowing my text editor really well. No editor I have used has been perfect but several have really great features or ways of working.

My ideal editor would work somewhat like vim, have a more hackable codebase, a good extension language, have the advanced display support of Emacs, and better IPC than either vim or Emacs.

In short, I think a vim-inspired editor implemented using modern software design would be incredible. Let's make it so!
